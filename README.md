# Trading-Bot-4U
Stock Trading Bot Script that is completely customizable. Backtested and working. May need some configuration but all in all this is a blueprint to get you started.
Everything that you need is listed in the instructions below. Anything that you will need to download is also free.
download notepad++ from this link
  https://notepad-plus-plus.org/

that's so you won't get format errors within your script.
ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Download and Install Python
Before running the bot, we need to install Python, which is the programming language it runs on.

ðŸ“Œ How to Install Python
Go to the official Python website:
ðŸ‘‰ https://www.python.org/downloads/
Click Download Python (latest version) for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Open the downloaded file and check the box that says "Add Python to PATH".
Click Install Now and wait for the installation to finish.
Once installed, open a Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux) and type:

python --version

If installed correctly, it will display something like:

Python 3.10.5










ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Install Required Python Libraries
The script uses several external libraries that must be installed before running.

ðŸ“Œ How to Install the Libraries
Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux).
Run the following command to install all required libraries:

pip install alpaca-trade-api yfinance pandas numpy TA-Lib


If you get an error related to TA-Lib, install it manually:
Windows Users: Download and install the TA-Lib binaries from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#ta-lib.
Mac Users: Run:

brew install ta-lib










ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Create an Alpaca Trading Account
Since this bot interacts with the Alpaca trading platform, you need an account.

ðŸ“Œ How to Set Up an Alpaca Account
Go to https://alpaca.markets/ and sign up for a free account.
After logging in, switch to Paper Trading (for testing) or Live Trading (for real money).
Go to API Keys & OAuth and click Generate API Key.
Copy the API Key and API Secret.

NOTE!!! Every day you will have to get a new alpaca API key and secret key and import them into your script for them to work because they will expire.











ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Configure the Script
Now that we have API credentials, we need to edit the script to include them.

ðŸ“Œ How to Enter Your API Credentials
Open the script in a code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, or Notepad++).
Locate the section:

API_KEY = "your_api_key"
API_SECRET = "your_api_secret"


Replace "your_api_key" and "your_api_secret" with your actual credentials.
For live trading, change this line:

BASE_URL = "https://paper-api.alpaca.markets"

To:

BASE_URL = "https://api.alpaca.markets"









ðŸ“Œ Detailed Description of What the Stock Trading Bot Can Do
This bot is an automated stock trading system designed to analyze stock prices, make buy/sell decisions based on technical indicators, and log trades. It operates in backtesting mode (simulating trades using historical data) and can be adapted for live trading with Alpacaâ€™s brokerage API.

ðŸ“Œ Main Features of the Trading Bot
âœ… 1. Connects to Alpaca API for Trading Execution
Uses Alpacaâ€™s API to place buy and sell orders.
Supports paper trading mode (simulated trades) and live mode (real trades).
Manages API credentials securely.



âœ… 2. Retrieves Historical Stock Data from Yahoo Finance
Uses yfinance to download 4 months of stock price history for analysis.
Fetches Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume data for each stock.
Can be modified to analyze a custom time range.



âœ… 3. Uses Technical Indicators to Make Trading Decisions
Computes Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify overbought and oversold conditions:
RSI < 30 â†’ Buy Signal (Stock is oversold).
RSI > 70 â†’ Sell Signal (Stock is overbought).
Computes Average True Range (ATR) to measure stock volatility.
Helps determine stop-loss and risk management strategies.



âœ… 4. Executes Automated Trading Strategies
Uses RSI and ATR to automatically decide whether to buy, sell, or hold stocks.
Splits available funds evenly across all stocks in the portfolio.
Trades Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), and SPY ETF by default (modifiable).
ðŸ“Œ Trading Strategy Logic
If RSI < 30 â†’ Buy shares with available balance.
If RSI > 70 â†’ Sell existing shares to lock in profits.
If RSI is between 30 and 70 â†’ Hold (no action taken).
Uses ATR to analyze market conditions but doesnâ€™t trigger trades directly yet.



âœ… 5. Manages Trading Capital & Simulates Profit and Loss
Starts with an initial balance of $10,000.
Adjusts available balance after each trade based on stock prices.
Calculates profit and loss (P&L) for each trade.
At the end of the backtest, it prints:
Starting balance
Final balance
Total profit or loss



âœ… 6. Logs All Trades for Analysis
Every buy/sell trade is recorded in a CSV file (trade_log.csv).
Stores details including:
Timestamp (date and time of the trade)
Stock symbol (e.g., TSLA, AAPL, SPY)
Trade action (Buy/Sell/Hold)
Trade price (Price at which the trade was executed)
Number of shares traded
Account balance after trade
This allows users to review past trades and improve strategy.



âœ… 7. Runs on a Scheduled Loop for Continuous Trading
Designed to execute trades daily based on the most recent stock data.
Can be expanded to run every minute or hour for day trading.
Uses time.sleep() to control execution timing in live trading mode.



âœ… 8. Easily Customizable
The script is built for flexibility and can be modified to:

Add more stocks to trade.
Change the trading strategy (e.g., different indicators, timeframes).
Adjust risk management rules (e.g., stop-loss, position sizing).
Use different data sources (Yahoo Finance, Alpaca, or another API).
